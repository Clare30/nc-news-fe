# NC News



## Intro

NC News is a news app created with React which displays news articles and allows logged in users to comment and vote on each article. Axios was used to fetch data from APIs from my [backend project](https://github.com/Clare30/nc-news) to populate the app. The [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework was used along side css to style the app. You can access the hosted app via netfliy [here](https://clarem.netlify.app/)
