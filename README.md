# NC News



## Intro

NC News is a news app created with React which displays news articles and allows logged in users to comment and vote on each article. APIs from my [backend project](https://github.com/Clare30/nc-news) were used to fetch the data and populate the app. The [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework was used along side css to style the app. You can access the hosted app [here](https://clarem.netlify.app/)
